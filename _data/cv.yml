              In the framework of the EU funded ITN-EID <a href="https://www.optimacs.net">OptiMACS</a>
              project, a research work involving the development of advanced failure models 
              for aerospace composite structures was carried out. The main contributions are: an extended laminate failure theory (details in 
              a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/aer.2021.121">journal article</a> 
              - <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10216/139464">available here</a> -,

              Within the <a href="https://www.optimacs.net">OptiMACS</a> project, the first contribution of this research work 
              consisted in the evaluation of state-of-art failure criteria and their implementation in post-processing tools (using Python) and 
              user subroutines for Abaqus (in Fortran) to perform hot-spot failure analysis in a FE context (work presented at the

             Research on ultrasonic inspection techniques for composites - 
             aligned with DAITAS project, funded by GKN Aerospace. During 
             this period I got the chance to understand the state-of-art technologies 
             on non-distructive inspections using ultrasounds, while studing the physics 
             behind it. Furthermore, I learned how to use CIVA to run simulations on 
             ultrasonic inspections on composite materials.

             During this internship period, the impact (simulating in-service tool drop 
             collisions) behaviour and compression after impact (CAI) resistance of a 
             thermoplastic stringer run-out was evaluated. 
             This experimental work was performed for the development of a
             thermoplastic composite area ruled rear fuselage section 
             for Gulfstream G650, based on butt joint half-T stringers.
