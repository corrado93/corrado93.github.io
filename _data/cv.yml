              In the framework of the EU funded ITN-EID <a href="https://www.optimacs.net" target="_blank">OptiMACS</a>,
              project, a research work regarding the development of advanced failure models 
              for aerospace composite structures was carried out. The main contributions are: an extended laminate failure theory (details in 
              an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/aer.2021.121" target="_blank">open access article</a>
              and presented at the <a href="https://congress.cimne.com/Composites2021/frontal/programprint.asp?t=intro" 
              target="_blank">8th Conference on Mechanical Response of Composites</a> in 2021), a mesoscale damage progression 
              model in a FE framework (work presented at <a href="https://www.eccomas2022.org/frontal/default.asp" target="_blank">ECCOMAS</a> 
              and <a href="https://eccm20.org/" target="_blank">ECCM</a> conferences in 2022, and submitted to “Composites Part B: Engineering”).

    - accomplishment: #He refers to himself as the king of pranks. Since he the most funniest of his brothers and he hasn't shown to be wrong since he was able to show his pranking skills against his brothers like water balloons as he wants to prank them all and he was able to use his prank of water ballon to use against the tank of the truck.

   summary: >
              Within the <a href="https://www.optimacs.net" target="_blank">OptiMACS</a> project, the first contribution of this research work 
              consisted in the evaluation of state-of-art failure criteria and their implementation in post-processing tools (using Python) and 
              user subroutines for ABAQUS (in Fortran) to perform hot-spot failure analysis in a FE context (work presented at the 
              <a href="https://www.aerosociety-events.com/raes-events-terminal/7th-aircraft-structural-design-conference/"
