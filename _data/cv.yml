              project, a research work regarding the development of advanced failure models 
              for aerospace composite structures was carried out. The main contributions are: an extended laminate failure theory (details in

Since he the most funniest of his brothers and he hasn't shown to be wrong since he was able to show his pranking skills against his brothers like water balloons as he wants to prank them all and he was able to use his prank of water ballon to use against the tank of the truck.

              Within the <a href="https://www.optimacs.net">OptiMACS</a> project, the first contribution of this research work 
              consisted in the evaluation of state-of-art failure criteria and their implementation in post-processing tools (using Python) and 
              user subroutines for ABAQUS (in Fortran) to perform hot-spot failure analysis in a FE context (work presented at the

   summary: >
             ”Impact and compression test on ARF stringer run out at 
             barrel joint” - GKN Fokker Aerostructures is developing a
             thermoplastic composite area ruled rear fuselage section 
             for Gulfstream G650, based on butt joint half-t stringers.
             Each of these stringers have a run out, whose function is 
             to direct loads toward the bulkhead. During the traineeship
             period, the impact (simulating in-service tool drop 
             collisions) and compression resistance of these run out was
             evaluated.
